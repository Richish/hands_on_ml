        "\n",
        "Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training instance. \n",
        "Not only does this make training extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good solution. This problem is often referred to as the curse of dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out that many things behave very differently in high-dimensional space. For example, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1 × 1 square), it will have only about a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it is very unlikely that a random point will be “extreme” along any dimension). But in a 10,000-dimensional unit hypercube (a 1 × 1 × ⋯ × 1 cube, with ten thousand 1s), this probability is greater than 99.999999%. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.\n",
        "\n",
        "More importantly:\n",
        "If you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly 0.52. If you pick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66. But what about two points picked randomly in a 1,000,000-dimensional hypercube? the average distance, will be about 408.25 (roughly sqrt(1,000,000/6!)) . This fact implies that high- dimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse: most training instances are likely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance will likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much less reliable than in lower dimensions, since they will be based on much larger extrapolations. In short, the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "With just 100 features (much less than in the MNIST problem), you would need more training instances than atoms in the observable universe in order for training instances to be within 0.1 of each other on average, assuming they were spread out uniformly across all dimensions.\n"

        "Reducing dimensionality does lose some information (just like compressing an image to JPEG can degrade its quality), so even though it will speed up training, it may also make your system perform slightly worse. It also makes your pipelines a bit more complex and thus harder to maintain. So you should first try to train your system with the original data before considering using dimensionality reduction if training is too slow. In some cases, however, reducing the dimensionality of the training data may filter out some noise and unnecessary details and thus result in higher performance (but in general it won’t; it will just speed up training).\n"

More generally, a d-dimensional manifold is a part of an n-dimensional space (where d < n) that locally resembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, d = 2 and n = 3: it locally resembles a 2D plane, but it is rolled in the third dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modeling the manifold on which the training instances lie; this is called Manifold Learning. It relies on the manifold assumption, also called the manifold hypothesis, which holds that most real-world high-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This assumption is very often empirically observed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once again, think about the MNIST dataset: all handwritten digit images have some similarities. They are made of connected lines, the borders are white, they are more or less centered, and so on. If you randomly generated images, only a ridiculously tiny fraction of them would look like handwritten digits. In other words, the degrees of freedom available to you if you try to create a digit image are dramatically lower than the degrees of freedom you would have if you were allowed to generate any image you wanted. These constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower- dimensional manifold\n",

        "It is also possible to decompress the reduced dataset back to 784 dimensions by applying the inverse transformation of the PCA projection. Of course this won’t give you back the original data, since the projection lost a bit of information (within the 5% variance that was dropped), but it will likely be quite close to the original data. The mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed data (compressed and then decompressed) is called the reconstruction error. For example, the following code compresses the MNIST dataset down to 154 dimensions, then uses the inverse_transform() method to decompress it back to 784 dimensions. "
